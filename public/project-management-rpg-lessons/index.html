<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Unlike most RPG video games, the (usual) goal of Dungeons and Dragons is not to win. The goal is to tell a good story. To that end, it is an extremely collaborative game. The players and game master together craft a narrative. There are heroes, villains, growth, remorse, and the usual range of human (or humanoid) emotion. Usually there is a fair bit of conflict too. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In my group, I act as the game master. Even though I’ve been leading professional teams for over a decade, I have learned a <!-- raw HTML omitted --><em><!-- raw HTML omitted -->lot<!-- raw HTML omitted --></em><!-- raw HTML omitted --> about project management in the process of adjudicating a world born out of my friends’ collective imaginations.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->There is a <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUMCIn2swTU"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->joke<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> within the roleplaying community: “Never split the party.” Each hero’s individual talents are not enough to stay alive in the dangerous fantasy settings where these games take place. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The first mistake that I made as a new game master was a big one. Instead of giving my group a shared sense of purpose and a common goal to work towards, I let each one of my players decide the individual motivations for their character. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This mistake actually led to a more realistic, though detrimental, dynamic within our group. In the real world, individuals come to a team with their own personal motivations and priorities, just like my D&amp;D players did. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Some are motivated by financial success, others by a sense of craftsmanship. The motives that drive us are as varied as we are. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>A team without aligned motivations and goals will find that they often argue unproductively. Consensus becomes nearly impossible without the common ground of shared values.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->On the other hand, a team with a shared purpose and a set of common values will find unexpected opportunities. When differences of opinion do arise, there can be healthy debates grounded in <!-- raw HTML omitted --><em><!-- raw HTML omitted -->objectives<!-- raw HTML omitted --></em><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

</h2>
<p>In the end, I solved my storytelling problem by having a sit down chat with my players, “out of game.” We discussed each person’s <em>real</em> motivations for playing. We then worked to create a set of character motivations that would be compatible (mostly — a little conflict can make the game fun).</p>
<p>As a group we decided that we wanted to tell a story about heroism and saving the world. From then on any debates were about <em>how</em> to achieve the group’s goals, rather than about <em>what</em> the group’s goals were in the first place.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Talk to your team about your organization’s values. This <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->can <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->be a mission statement, but it doesn’t have to be. What is important is that every member of your team is willing to <!-- raw HTML omitted --><em><!-- raw HTML omitted -->embrace and advance <!-- raw HTML omitted --></em><!-- raw HTML omitted -->your stated purpose.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
