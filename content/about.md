Whether it’s operators or observability, agile or accessibility, my expertise shines because I’m passionate about all of it. Quick to propose elegant solutions to multifaceted problems, I often arrive at innovative answers by taking into account small nuances or correlations that were overlooked by others.

While my technical expertise has proven indispensable to clients over the years, they truly appreciate me for me ability to explain complex software in accessible ways.

I have over a decade of experience leading cross-functional teams as a consultant. I'm currently a Developer Advocate for Open Source at Altinity (services for ClickHouse on Kubernetes). Before that I worked on OpenTelemetry and open-source integrations at IBM Instana (observability platform).
