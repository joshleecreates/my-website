# DevOps is a Foreign Language (or Why There Are No Junior SREs)

[Slides]('/slides/Devops is a Foreign Language FOSSY 2025.pdf')

DevOps has a notoriously steep learning curve. Getting started in the field can feel like being dropped in a foreign country without the ability to understand *anything* about the language.

This talk explores parallels between learning DevOps and acquiring a foreign language, drawing on Second Language Acquisition hypotheses to provide insights for DevOps practitioners, trainers, tool builders, and learners.
