# Running Databases in Kubernetes the Cloud Native Way

Kubernetes is all the rage in enterprise IT today. Your boss just read that databases are going cloud native and wants you to make it happen. This talk tells you how. We’ll start with a quick overview of the wants and needs of your average database. We’ll then show practical ways to map those needs to Kubernetes resources, including Deployments, Stateful Sets, and custom resources managed by operators. We’ll end with a quick tour of key issues like security, backups, upgrade, and scale-out. By the end of the talk you’ll understand the standard patterns for managing databases on Kubernetes and have links to working code that can take your studies first. Join us!
