# Modern Application Debugging: An Intro to OpenTelemetry

In this talk, Joshua will share his insights and experiences with OpenTelemetry, an open-source project that offers protocols, APIs, and SDKs for collecting metrics, traces, and logs from applications and services. He will cover the comprehensive toolkit provided by the OpenTelemetry community, including language SDKs, the Collector, and the OTLP formats for metrics, traces, and logs.

He will demonstrate how to instrument and monitor a microservices application running on a Kubernetes cluster, utilizing the full potential of OpenTelemetry. Attendees will learn how to use powerful open-source tools like Jaeger and Prometheus to effectively analyze telemetry signals from their applications.

By the end of this session, attendees will have a solid understanding of how to implement OpenTelemetry in their projects, enhancing their debugging and observability practices. Join us as we delve into the world of OpenTelemetry, unlocking the capabilities of this powerful technology for your development needs.
