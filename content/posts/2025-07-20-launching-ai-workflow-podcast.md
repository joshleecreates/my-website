I'm excited to announce the launch of a new limited-series podcast focused on AI workflows, automation, and how we're all adapting to this rapidly changing landscape.

## Why This Podcast?

The pace of change has made the future foggy. My co-host [Mya](https://mya.sh/) and I don't know what it looks like, but we believe:

- The proliferation of autonomous agents will make it even more important to have authoritative and verifiable sources of truth.
- The mechanisms we use to share context with and collaborate with LLMs will be one of the most productive areas for advancement within the next 1-2 years.
- When applied effectively, AI agents reduce tedium and increase the time that we get to spend on creative higher-level thinking.

We're openly sharing our learning journey and how we're adapting to these changes.

## Episode 1: Now Available

The first episode is now available on YouTube where we dive into the foundations of AI workflows and set the stage for what's to come.

## Upcoming Episodes

Here's our upcoming schedule (typically Fridays at 2:00 Central / 3:00 Eastern):

### Episode 2 - Workflows & One-shots
Can AI Workflows produce clean, actionable structured data? In this episode we'll build on our progress from episode 1, building AI automation workflows based around a personal database. We'll integrate FreshRSS, Huginn, n8n and baserow with MCPs and Claude Desktop. Then we'll let coding agents lose to create one-shot UIs for interacting with the data.

### Episode 3 - Agents & Assistants
Is chat the only interface you need? Maybe. In this episode we'll extend our workflows into agentic chat interfaces - and maybe even add voice chat!

### Episode 4 - Homelab & Nix
If it can be committed to git, it can be used as context for an AI. It turns out that LLMs + declarative configuration are a powerful combo. In this episode we'll dive further into the "text-based-life" and learn how Josh manages his homelab with NixOS.

### Episode 5 - Modern 12 Factor
Heroku is back on the scene with an update to their 12-factor app for the cloud-native age. What does this really mean? How does it stand up in the face of LLM-based coding assistants?

## Join the Journey

Subscribe to follow along as we explore the intersection of AI, automation, and modern development practices. Each episode will include practical demonstrations, real-world applications, and honest discussions about what works and what doesn't.

Stay tuned for more episodes starting [this friday](https://www.youtube.com/live/u75AsRspfr0?si=5ds-0PDakrU8hIvC)!
