<span style="font-weight: 400">Game masters also have an inside joke: “No plot survives contact with the players.” </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">When I attempt to drive the plot, dictate the player options and the pacing, the players begin to disengage. The same thing happens on teams when a leader begins to white-knuckle the steering wheel. </span>

## **A Glimpse Into the Story**

<span style="font-weight: 400">The heroes are facing almost certain doom. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Upon entering a room </span>*<span style="font-weight: 400">full</span>*<span style="font-weight: 400"> of bones, they catch a glimpse of the artifact they seek. But it turns out to be a fake. And then the bones come to life.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">I’ve invested a </span>*<span style="font-weight: 400">lot </span>*<span style="font-weight: 400">of time preparing for an epic and climactic battle. I spent at least 6 hours preparing this scene, arranging scores of skeleton miniatures.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400"> It is our first hero’s turn to attack…</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">I wait for them to tell me how many feet forward they’d like to step and which spell they’d like to cast. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Instead, they announce that they’d like to use one of their abilities to teleport the entire party away from the combat… My head rolls in exasperation.</span>

> <span style="font-weight: 400">No plot survives contact with the players.</span>

## **Lesson 2: Knowing When to Let Go**

<span style="font-weight: 400">As GM, I could have easily hand-waved a reason for the teleportation not to work. I could have forced the players to follow </span>*<span style="font-weight: 400">my plan</span>*<span style="font-weight: 400"> that I had so carefully prepared.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">But that would have deprived my players of agency. In the game, my role is to provide challenges — ideally at the edge of achievable — and it is my </span>*<span style="font-weight: 400">player’s </span>*<span style="font-weight: 400">role to provide solutions. Just because I haven’t anticipated a solution doesn’t make it the wrong solution.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">I quickly dismantled the battle scene that I had spent so long creating, and we move on. In the end, it’s one of the most dramatic and satisfying sessions of the entire campaign.</span>

*<span style="font-weight: 400">(Of course, I didn’t let them get away completely — but used the teleportation as a way to take them out of the frying pan and into the fire. The analogy for professional life breaks here.)</span>*

<span style="font-weight: 400">Even with the god-like powers of a game master, I cannot create a compelling narrative alone; The players drive the plot as much or more than I do. And the party often goes places I never expected — which is fantastic. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">When this happens sometimes I can adapt on the fly, appropriating whatever material I had prepared for what I </span>*<span style="font-weight: 400">thought </span>*<span style="font-weight: 400">would happen. Often though, I end up discarding carefully prepared material in order to go with the flow. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">I just have to let it go. Something entirely new and unexpected happens. The story is better for it and the sessions are more fun. </span>

## **The Solution is Trust**

<span style="font-weight: 400">Being willing to let go is crucial to success with a team. But it certainly isn’t easy. We get attached to our work, our ways of doing things, and even (</span>*<span style="font-weight: 400">especially!</span>*<span style="font-weight: 400">) our opinions.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">New priorities caused by external events (or internal ones) can necessitate letting go of carefully crafted plans and schedules. New requirements can mean discarding days or weeks of work.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">This is ok.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">As I wrote in the last piece about goals, it is important to stay focused on the overall objective. A truly agile</span>*<span style="font-weight: 400"> (not </span>*<span style="font-weight: 400">Agile</span>*<span style="font-weight: 400">) </span>*<span style="font-weight: 400">team must be able to check their egos and find a new path forward even when the landscape shifts.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">So how can you foster this open, ego-free collaboration and problem solving?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">One key is psychological safety. HBR has written on the importance of </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400">psychological safety in the workplace</span>](https://hbr.org/2017/08/high-performing-teams-need-psychological-safety-heres-how-to-create-it)<span style="font-weight: 400">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">At my tabletop, our psychological safety comes from the knowledge that we’re all friends and all only acting out a story — and even then, egos can flare and clash. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">On a professional team it is even more difficult to maintain trust and psychological safety. We must repeatedly remind ourselves and our team that it’s ok for anybody to:</span>

- <span style="font-weight: 400">Make mistakes.</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400">Admit (and own) mistakes.</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400">Offer a perspective or opinion — anytime.</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400">Offer challenges or objections, while avoiding shaming or blaming.</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400">Discard work or change plans to accommodate new requirements.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">On my own teams, I like to use the mantra “Problems are ok, surprises are not.” as a quick encapsulation of these permissions.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">How do you foster an environment for open collaboration? </span>
